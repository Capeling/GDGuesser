# GDGuesser
Guess the date!

Inspired by [this video by Doggie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cglfVPbajHk), **GDGuesser** allows you to guess the date published of a random rated level.

### Modes
- <cy>**Normal**</c> - Guess the level based on the <cg>level name, author, difficulty</c> and level itself
- <cr>**Hardcore**</c> - Guess the level based on <cr>nothing but the song and the level itself.</c>

Scores submitted in Normal mode are out of 500, while Hardcore mode scores are out of 600.

### Leaderboards
Rise to the top of the leaderboards by consistently accurately guessing levels!
